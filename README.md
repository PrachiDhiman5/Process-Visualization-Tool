# Process Scheduling Visualization Tool
## Overview
The Process Scheduling Visualization Tool is an interactive educational application designed to 
help students, researchers, and professionals understand the intricacies of CPU process scheduling 
algorithms. By providing a comprehensive graphical interface, this tool allows users to simulate, 
analyze, and visualize different scheduling strategies in real-time.

## Features
